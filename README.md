# LinearRegression

Introdution of Project

Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

Summary of Project

In this project, a linear regression model was built to predict users' annual spending using four factors: 'Avg. Session Length,' 'Time on App,' 'Time on Website,' and 'Length of Membership.' The model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 98%.

To further increase annual spending, focusing on extending the Length of Membership is recommended, as it showed the highest correlation with spending. However, the costs of increasing membership duration should be weighed against the potential revenue gains. Additionally, investing heavily in the Website may not be necessary, as it had minimal impact on annual spending.
